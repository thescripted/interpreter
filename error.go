// error.go should be the error library for all the shit that fucks up. Is that ok? I have no idea.
// I think this is necessary because errors will pop up throughout parsing/lexing/scanning. There will be multiple different errors.
// all error types will exists here. We will surface users here from here. And some other stuff.
